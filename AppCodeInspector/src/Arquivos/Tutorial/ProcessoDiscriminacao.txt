• Discrimination Stage: 

At this stage the moderator, the author of the artifact and inspectors should meet and discuss found discrepancies, excluding false positives. 

Remarks: 

• If the team decides that a defective passage was correctly identified and classified each inspector will receive 1 score even if it was different from the registered defect.
• Easy level artifacts passage will not appear in the list, only its classification will.
