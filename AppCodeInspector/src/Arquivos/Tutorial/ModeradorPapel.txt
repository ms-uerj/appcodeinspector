Moderator Role:

In this role you will be able to moderate an inspection session by defining its artifacts and inspectors or by discriminating the real defects from the false positives found by the round's inspectors. The discrimination stage will only be available once an inspectors have finished inspecting at least 1 of the round's artifact.

Stages with moderator interaction:

• Planning.
• Collection.
• Discrimination.
• Continuation.

Remarks:

• In discrimination stage, if the round inspection team (i.e., Moderator plus its inspectors) every confirmed defect will add 1 score to all inspectors that identified in the same defect and classified in the same category.
• Discrimination stage screen will show all inspection rounds created for that moderator.
• Discrimination stage will only be available once an inspection role is created and an inspector finishes inspecting at least 1 artifact.
