Inspector Role:

In this role, you will have to identify and classify defects by reviewing software artifacts defined by a moderator 

Inspector's Process Stages:

• Detection.
• Discrimination.

Remarks:

• Wrongly identified or classified artifacts won’t be considered.
• Each rightly identified defect worth’s 1 score. In basic and intermediary artifact difficulty levels, there is a defect per artifact. In high difficulty level there is more than one defect per artifact.
• Detection stage will only be available once a moderator includes the user in an inspection round.
• For the defect selection always select the entire textual line in which the defect is to be found.
