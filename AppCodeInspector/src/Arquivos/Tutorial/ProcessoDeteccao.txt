• Detection Stage: 

In this stage, you will need to find defects in software artifacts defined by a moderator using the correct classification for each defect you found. 

Remarks: 

• Identification and classification errors will not be accounted. 
• Each correctly identified defect and each classification will score 1 point respectively. In easy and medium level artifacts, there is a defect per artifact. 
  In Hard difficulty artifacts, there will be more than one defect per artifact. 
• Easy level artifacts, the chosen defect passage will not appear in the list since its already highlighted, but the classification associated with it will.
