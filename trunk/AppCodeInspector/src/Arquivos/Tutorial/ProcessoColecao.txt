• Collection Stage: 

In this stage, the moderator reviews work carried out by inspectors and eliminates redundancies in the discrepancies found so that in the discrimination stage there will be only one instance of each found defect/classification. 

Remarks: 

• This step is done automatically by the game, (i.e., when inspectors find the same defect and with the same classification, the game engine will automatically present only 1 instance of it at the discrimination screen).
